Purpose:
Image de/compression package using the JPEG standard. This results in large
storage savings at the expense of some loss of picture quality. There are 2
programs - cjpeg to compress and djpeg to decompress. This is the latest
production release and provides archive and shared libraries for use by other
packages.

Files changed:

* Makefile.in:
  - "gmake clean" now also deletes config.cache.

* configure:
  - Cache file is now config.cache, rather than /dev/null.
  - Set up an HP-UX override section, including:
    * Set prefix to /usr/local.
    * Put /usr/local/bin in the front of the PATH.
    * If Itanium, set libdir to /usr/local/lib/hpux32.
    * Compile with "cc -O".
    * Set RANLIB to /bin/true.
    * Enable both shared and static library building.
  - Strip any installed binaries.
  - Set 755 permissions on any installed scripts.
  - Don't link with +h <libname>.
  - Only build <libname>.<libext> as a shared lib (i.e. no version numbers).

To compile:
 
[Uninstall any previously installed jpeg release first!]

 particularly the prefix setting]
./configure
gmake
 
To test:
